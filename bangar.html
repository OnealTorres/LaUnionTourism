                <p class="excert text-justify">
                  The town of Bangar got its name from the bangar tree which,
                  during the Spanish regime, was growing abundantly in the place
                  where the town now stands. The bangar tree which is more known
                  because of the foul odor that emanates from its fruit had
                  other valuable usages. Planks made from the dried tree were
                  prized boards for the interior of houses while its fruits when
                  soaked in oil are used as deep red dye for the hand woven
                  products. The “indios infieles” (Spanish term given to people
                  who were not yet Christianized) used to spacious shade of the
                  tree in performing their superstitious cult. <br />
                  <br />
                  The old town of Bangar was made of three “pueblecitos” (small
                  towns) namely: Villa-Cruz, San Rafael and San Anastacio. Near
                  these “pueblecitos” were small communities of the “Igorotes
                  Infieles” who paid tribute to the Governor. On the northern
                  side of the town flowed the Amburayan river which later on
                  became the setting of the Ilocano epic Biag ni Lam-ang penned
                  by the Prince of Ilocano Poets, Pedro Bucaneg. This river was
                  also another source of income for the inhabitants because in
                  it were gold dusts and granules which were panned and
                  collected. On the eastern side, the hills and mountains were
                  forested with different kinds of timbers. It was there where
                  the people got timber for their houses. On the western side of
                  the town flowed the Busilac river which was a favorite fishing
                  ground for the residents. Farther on the eastern side at a
                  distance which was covered by ten hours of walking was the
                  village Panguatan and still father away was Bacong. These two
                  communities were inhabited by pagans.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The year 1700 marked the official foundation of Bangar under
                  the patronage of Saint Christopher when it became a ministry.
                  However, Christianity was brought as early as in the later
                  part of 1500 when Bangar was still a visita of Tagudin. The
                  book Historia Agustiniana which was authored by Fr. Isacio R.
                  Rodriguez stated that the massive church was started in 1696
                  and was finished in 1697 by Fr. Francisco Alvear, a learned
                  Spanish Augustinian priest born in Liaño Santander, Spain. He
                  died in Bangar in 1698.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Through the “Superior Decreto” (executive decree) signed by
                  Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco on March 2, 1850, the
                  town of Bangar was made a part of La Union, the newly created
                  province. Before 1850, Bangar, Purao (Balaoan) and Namacpacan
                  (Luna) were parts of Ilocos Sur.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The beginning of World War II was felt in Bangar on December
                  8, 1941. Planes were constantly flying and on December 10, the
                  townspeople fled to the barrios and nearby hills bringing
                  along with them only important things. People stayed at
                  evacuation places until it was safe for them to return to the
                  town.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Underground movement was very strong in Bangar at that time,
                  Many residents joined the guerillas which had put up camps in
                  Barangay San Cristobal led by Colonel Volkman and Major
                  Agtarap. Three years later, the Japanese raided their camp and
                  burned houses at the town proper.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  There were also soldiers who were very kind, friendly, and
                  understanding. They took time to teach the youth ball games,
                  athletics and other information about Japan.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Bangar is famous for its loom-weaving industry. The big bulk
                  of orders for placemats, towels, draperies, curtains, blankets
                  and even bathrobes from all over the country and even abroad
                  speaks well of the quality of Bangar woven products.
                  Agriculture, however, still remains the main source of income
                  for the people of Bangar. Its principal crop is rice while
                  tobacco comes next. Farmers also find planting corn, peanuts,
                  and vegetable crops as a quite lucrative source of additional
                  income in between cropping.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Fishing also occupies a greater time of the people from the
                  coastal barangays of Bangar. Ipon which comes out from the
                  month of August to April is caught abundantly along these
                  coastal areas. Bangus fry is caught from March to the earlier
                  part of July. Tuna fish locally known as oriles and codfish
                  abound in the coastal waters of this town. The Amburayan river
                  also teems with fresh water varieties of fish (purong, tibek
                  and birot) and shell (jusiling, suso and gusipeng).<br />
