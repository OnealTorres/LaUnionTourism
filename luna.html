                <p class="excert text-justify">
                  The Town of Luna was formerly called Namacpacan. “Namacpacan”
                  is an ilocano word which means “one who had given food.”
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Based on early records, Namacpacan was a visita (a settlement
                  with a church but is visited by non-resident clergies whose
                  headquarters are at the cabecera) of Purao, now Balaoan, as
                  early as 1587. It was a settlement along the camino real
                  (national road) from Vigan to Manila and travelers stopped and
                  refresh themselves at that place. The era of restaurants was
                  not yet introduced during that time, and so the families of
                  that town offered the travelers food and shelter, hence, the
                  name of the place.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The settlement grew and on November 25, 1690, Namacpacan was
                  founded as a town and parish with St. Catherine of Alexandria,
                  virgin and martyr, as patroness. Since then, the town and
                  patronal fiesta have always been celebrated every November 25.
                  The original site of the town was in Darigayos, as settlement
                  with a small cove which served as a harbor for sea-going
                  vessels. In 1741, the parish was transferred to the place
                  where it is now.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The town of Luna has become a by-word especially among
                  catholic devotees because of the several miracles that are
                  attributed to our Lady of Namacpacan. Our lady of Namacpacan
                  is a beautiful image of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It was in
                  1871 when a galleon that came all the way from Mexico to
                  deliver a statue of the Blessed Virgin to the Immaculate
                  Concepcion Seminary in Vigan, Ilocos sur, stopped by Darigayos
                  to seek cover from the stormy weather. According to
                  traditional accounts, when the storm, is over, the galleon
                  could not proceed to its destination because the sea became
                  rough and unnavigable whenever the crew launched the vessel.
                  They decided to bring the statue to Vigan by land. While
                  making preparations, the statue was brought to the convent.
                  The church at that time was undergoing repairs on the damaged
                  portions brought about by a strong earthquake.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The following morning, before heading to Vigan, the men could
                  not move the statue from the place where it stood. Fray Camilo
                  Naves, an Augustinian priest, interpreted this as a message
                  that the Blessed Virgin wanted her statue to remain in the
                  parish. Negotiations were made with Church authorities who
                  ordered the statue from Spain. It was agreed that the
                  Catholics from Namacpacan would reimburse all expenses
                  incurred and the parishioners contributed joyously and
                  generously to the extent of selling portions of their fields
                  to raise the amounts. An altar at the northern portion side of
                  the church was constructed to house the statue of the Blessed
                  Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Namacpacan.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On October 18, 1906, during the incumbency of Governor Joaquin
                  Luna and Namacpacan Mayor Primitivo Resurreccion Novicio, the
                  name of the town was changed to Namacpacan to Luna by virtue
                  of Philippine Commission Act No. 1543. It was the first town
                  that altered its name since the creation of the province in
                  1850. The change was based on the request of the municipal
                  council which was subsequently approved and endorsed by the
                  Provincial Board of La Union, in honor of the famous Luna
                  brothers: Antonio, the General and Juan, the Painter, whose
                  mother Doña Laureana Novicio Luna, was a native of the
                  locality.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  During the Liberation period or the latter part of the
                  Japanese occupation, the general headquarters of the United
                  States Armed Forces in the Philippines, Northern Luzon
                  (USAFIP-NL) was transferred from Alibangsay, Bagulin to
                  Daringayos. Here, a military camp named after American solider
                  Private Grafton Spencer was established. At Camp Spencer, the
                  USAFIP-NL planned their operations and mapped out strategies
                  for the capture of General Yamashita. It was also at Camp
                  Spencer where Yamashita was held prisoner before he was
                  executed at the Los Baños Prisoner of War Camp.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Darigayos was likewise the landing site of the United States
                  Navy submarine named “GAR” that unloaded 25 tons of
                  ammunition, arms, communication equipment and supplies for the
                  USAFIP-NL. This rendezvous, only seven kilometers from the
                  nearest Japanese garrison in Balaoan, was coordinated and
                  supervised by Major Parker Calvert of the USAFIP-NL in
                  cooperation with the Filipino-American forces and the
                  townspeople of Luna.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  At present, the main occupation of the people is agricultural
                  farming. Rise is planted twice or thrice a year in some areas.
                  In between cropping, people plant vegetables and root crops.
                  Next to farming, fishing is the most important occupation of
                  the residents of Luna especially the inhabitants along the
                  coastal areas. Various kinds of fishes and different species
                  of edible sea weed and sea shells abound in the seawater of
                  Luna.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Luna is also known for its stone-picking industry which is the
                  main source of income of 14 of its barangays. These stones
                  have found market not only in the country but also overseas.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Luna is also home to the famous Ilocano delicacies bibingka
                  and tupig. Damili products (clay products) of various kinds
                  are also made in barangay Barrientos.<br />
