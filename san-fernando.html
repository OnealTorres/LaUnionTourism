                <p class="excert text-justify">
                  The City of San Fernando is the first city created in the
                  province of La Union by virtue of Republic Act 8509, sponsored
                  by the Congressman Victor F. Ortega in the House of
                  Representatives, signed by President Fidel V. Ramos on
                  February 13, 1998 and was ratified by a plebiscite on March
                  20, 1998. <br />
                  <br />
                  The City of San Fernando is situated in the mountainous area
                  at almost the mid-section of La Union along the China Sea. It
                  was founded in 1786 and made the “cabecera” or provincial
                  capital on the same day that La Union became province in 1850.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  During the Spanish times, a settlement was a place where there
                  were about 200 families. Around this area, there were two
                  settlements, San Vicente de Balanac and San Guillermo de
                  Dalangdang, San Vicente de Balanac was along the coast and
                  during summer, when the sea was calm and perfect for sailing,
                  pirates would come and plunder the settlement, taking along
                  with them the women and children leaving behind them a trail
                  of blood. San Guillermo de Dalangdang, however, was at the
                  foothills of the Cordillera mountains, and during summer, when
                  the fire trees were in bloom, the populace was attacked by
                  headhunters who saw in the red flowers of fire trees, a sign
                  of the gods asking for human offerings.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In 1759, an Augustinian priest, Father Jose Torres, convinced
                  the two settlements to come together to a place not so near
                  the sea and not so near the mountains so they will not be
                  plagued by their annual problems. They chose the area called
                  Pindangan, meaning, a place where they dry fish and in this
                  place, they built in a church with San Guillermo the Hermit as
                  the patron saint. In 1765, the newly assigned priest, however,
                  suggested to the inhabitants that they change the name of
                  Pindangan to San Fernando, after the Catholic King of Spain,
                  retaining San Guillermo as their patron saint. The name of the
                  parish priest was Father Fernando Rey, Rey being the Spanish
                  word for King. This was also the time of Diego Silang, and as
                  we know, Silang would travel to and from Manila on his white
                  horse and was killed on May 28, 1763. When an earthquake
                  destroyed the church at Pindangan, renamed San Fernando, the
                  parish priest decided not to rebuild in the same place because
                  during the rainy season, the church was transferred until it
                  found its present place, and it is now called the Cathedral of
                  St. William the Hermit, of the Diocese of San Fernando, La
                  Union.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On May 1786, the Ministerio de San Fernando was established.
                  However, due to lack of priests during the period 1792 to
                  1831, San Fernando became a “visita” of Bauang and San Juan.
                  In 1831, Father Juan Sorolla, the parish priest of Bauang in
                  1829, was assigned in San Fernando.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  According to historical records, the construction of the
                  present church started in 1817 by Father Simon Torrado with
                  Father Sorolla as its first parish priest.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  San Fernando has grown slowly from the time it was founded.
                  This slow growth maybe attributed to the fact that travels
                  during those days was long and tedious. Sectionalism was
                  rampant because education was not widely diffused.
                  Intermingling of the people was limited to neighboring towns.
                  Only the well-to-do and the powerful obtained their education
                  and this too, was limited as it was then the policy of the
                  Spaniards to deny education to the masses. In spite of this
                  backward policy, the people improved economically,
                  educationally and spiritually. An offshoot of this improvement
                  was the revolt of the people against the Spaniards which
                  assumed in greater proportions when the Spaniards became
                  abusive. Although the people were subservient to the ruling
                  power, there were fateful prohibitions that cut deep into the
                  private life of the people which found outlet in the form of
                  uprisings and occasional revolts to give vent to their pent-up
                  emotions. The climax came in 1896 when the country was swept
                  by a widespread revolt. In 1898, the Spanish garrison in San
                  Fernando was attacked by Filipino insurgents under the
                  leadership of General Manuel Tinio and Mauro Ortiz. In the
                  end, the Filipinos prevailed over the Spaniards.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Then the Americans came. Spain fell in ruins, victims of her
                  own greed and ambition. San Fernando experienced naval
                  bombardment of the Americans as well as actual fighting on
                  land when General Gregorio del Pilar commanded the rearguard
                  of General Emilio Aguinaldo to cover the latter’s retreat. In
                  a short while, Aguinaldo and his officers and soldiers were
                  captured by the Americans. Peace and order were restored. A
                  democratic form of government took the place of that once
                  proud despotic government of Spain. The people of San Fernando
                  took advantage of all the Americans could teach - politically
                  and economically. San Fernando progressed with the rest of the
                  towns in the province.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In 1941, the Japanese came. Japanese planes bombed San
                  Fernando. The guerillas of the 21st Infantry became active and
                  engaged a do-or-die battle against the Japanese Imperial
                  Forces. A bloody fighting took place in Barrio Bacsil until
                  the town was liberated in 1945.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The destruction of property in San Fernando was appalling.
                  Only few houses remained standing in what was once a thriving
                  town of beautiful houses. Thus, from the nibbles of war, San
                  Fernando rose until it became the administrative capital of
                  Region I.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In May 14, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan of San Fernando passed
                  Resolution No. 20 requesting the House of Representatives,
                  Congress of the Philippines for the conversion of the
                  Municipality of San Fernando into a Component City. That time,
                  the municipality of San Fernando had satisfactorily met the
                  basic requirements for its conversion into cityhood pursuant
                  to the provisions of the Local Government Code 1991. In a
                  certification issued by the Bureau of Local Government
                  Finance, the average annual income of San Fernando for
                  calendar years 1994, and 1995 based on 1991 constant prices
                  was P 44,351,821.66. Further, in a certification by the Land
                  Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural
                  Resources, the land area of San Fernando is 10,526 hectares,
                  well above the minimum requirement of 10,000 hectares.

                  comprehensive study and judicious evaluation of the petition
                  of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Fernando, adopted Resolution
                  No. 425-96 endorsing its cityhood bid to the House of
                  Representatives, Congress of the Philippines.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Upon the sponsorship of the Congressman Victor F. Ortega (1st
                  District- La Union) at the House of Representatives, House
                  Bill 7594 (Act Converting the Municipality of San Fernando, La
                  Union into a Component City to be known as City of San
                  Fernando) was approved.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The petition was likewise approved at the Upper House through
                  the sponsorship of Senators Vicente Sotto III and Juan
                  Flavier. On February 13, 1998, Republic Act 8509 was signed
                  into law by President Fidel V. Ramos and finally on March 20,
                  1998, the residents of San Fernando manifested their
                  resounding YES in the Plebiscite that ratified the said law,
                  thus, the fulfillment of the dream for San Fernando to become
                  a city.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Located some 8 kilometers from the city proper, on a forest
                  mountain is nestled the La Union Botanical Garden – a green
                  spot on the map that is probably the only one of its kind in
                  the country. The 10 hectare garden located at Barngay Cadaclan
                  is a display of varied species of living plants and a
                  sanctuary of varieties of wild animals. Clean and green are
                  the bywords of the garden which provide the visitors maximum
                  satisfaction and a healthful promenade.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The City of San Fernando is now the seat of national
                  government agencies in Region I and center of trade, commerce,
                  financial and educational institutions, among others. From a
                  deep rooted potential of stable community governance to the
                  best gift of Mother Nature- a seaport community responsive to
                  international shipping, an airport with viable capacity to
                  accommodate international air traffic, natural terrain
                  conducive to tourism development and a people endowed with
                  cultural and virtuous heritage of industry, spirituality,
                  nationalism and aspiration for growth, peace and prosperity,
                  the City of San Fernando has emerged as the booming Metropolis
                  of the North.<br />
